Hi Dr. Lyden,

Just wanted to follow up on the call today and share the latest imaging metrics from the pilot scans (please see attached csv).  Please let me know if I can provide any more info, and also how I can help with setting up the validation experiment from the call today -- thought it was a productive discussion, by the way!

Cheers,
Ryan
