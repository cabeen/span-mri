Great to hear.  I actually jumped the gun and ran an experiment with new thresholds, so I guess I'll share those results in case they are helpful.

I took case KX0579 as a guide and tried a new T2 threshold that included an area similar to the example image attached from Iowa.  I then reprocessed the other cases and compared the auto vs manual volumetrics again.  Here's a summary of results:

* correlation between manual raters = 0.967 (p=3.7e-6)
* correlation between auto and manual = 0.957 (p=1.4e-5)

* rms error in volume between manual raters = 2.2 mm^3
* rms error in volume between auto and manual = 3 mm^3

So it looks like this improved the agreement quite a bit (perhaps the differences are even negligible).  I've attached a report of the pipeline outputs and analysis, as well as images with lesion boundaries, in case you all would like to review those.

It should be interesting to see how this kind of comparison plays out with the manual segmentations from other sites -- and of course, glad to handle pipeline updates however you'd like, being cautious about changes makes sense to me too.
