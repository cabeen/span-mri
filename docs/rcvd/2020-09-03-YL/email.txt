Dear Ryan,
 
I hope you are doing good. We obtained  5 more scans for day 2 . I have uploaded them today. Please find the details in the attached word file. We had issues on previous 30 day scans. That is the reason we are repeating these experiments and hopefully will have 30 day scan on these 5  mice on 9/29 .
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
By the way I am very impressed with your analytic skills on this project. Thanks for helping us on this.
 
 
Best Regards
Basav
