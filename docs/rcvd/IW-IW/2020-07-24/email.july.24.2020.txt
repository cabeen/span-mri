I have uploaded images from our current version of the SPAN protocol labeled as subject UI0000. Here is also attached a text file with the echo time and b-value information. It only occurred to me after I uploaded that perhaps you wanted it in with the image data folders; I can re-upload tomorrow morning if needed. The information is reproduced here in the order acquired.

Site: Iowa
T2 echo-times: 45 30 15
b-values: 1000 500 0
T2* echo-times: 5 10 15 20

As we are the outlier non-Bruker site, I wanted to pass along additional notes and get any comments or preferences as to our protocol and the way the data comes out of our scanner. I have access to animals that we can run some additional test studies prior to our first pilot study scan.

GENERAL NOTES

* Our scanner uses a clinical console, so the 'patient' entry and anatomical directions assumes a human is in the scanner. Consequently, the anatomical coordinates don't match actual mouse anatomy, since an anatomically axial scan for a human brain ends up being an anatomically coronal scan to a mouse brain (anatomically, it's as if the human entered the scanner nose first, i.e. standing up!). There really isn't flexibility at the console to alter this at the time of scan setup. If this causes any problems, I may be able to make some pre-upload alterations to fix. 

* Although images are acquired with a 128x128 matrix, the scanner produces DICOM images at 256x256. If this is a problem, I can look into seeing if there is a way to get 'native' resolution out, but I don't know for certain if it is possible. 

* For all scans, I used frequency direction A/P which matches what we typically run and what we would use in human scans. I didn't see anything explicit about this in the documents, but could modify if this was incorrect. 

* For all scans, I have used bandwidth of 31.25 kHz which is what we have historically used for most studies. This was done to help bring image quality up just a bit to compensate for our lower field (7 T). It should be possible to acquire at 50 kHz if that is too much of a change. 

Specific sequence notes:

RARE_Anatomy
* I assumed that 8 segments meant that 16 lines per segments are acqured for a total of (8 segments)*(16 lines/segment) = 128 lines. On our scanner, this puts the TR very high, more than 9 seconds and yielding an overall scan time of nearly nine minutes. I suspect this is a result of the relatively long refocusing pulses used in this sequence. As a compromise, I used 12 lines per segment to get the scan time to a more reasonable 5:35. There may be possibilities for tightening this up.

* In this run, the TE was entered as 60ms but the effective TE reported ended up being slightly shorter at about 57ms. I can adjust to get it past 60ms if needed. 

T2_map
* This used three single-echo acquisitions. I did not see a recommended TR for this version, so it was run at 2400ms to keep the times reasonable. For the test scan, the scans were run in reverse order of echo time to make sure that all parameters would fit in the longest echo before moving to the shorter ones. We do have multi-echo spin-echo sequence, but I believe as it stands it only permits a maximum of four echoes. There might be a possibility to alter the sequence to expand this.

ADC_map
* This is the custom sequence I built based on the standard spin-echo. The acquisition uses b = 1000, 500, and 0. The amplitude and duration of the diffusion gradients are different than the Bruker parameters presented to me due to our lower gradient strength (60 G/cm) to keep them within duty cycle limits. I may experiment a bit more with the precise durations, timings, amplitudes, but will adjust to keep the b values the same.

T2Star_map
* This is a multi-echo sequence and echo times of 5, 10, 15, and 20 ms were chosen. There is some contradictory information in the last MRI document I have from July 2 (first it says "Suggested echo times: 5 to 30 ms in steps of 5 ms" but the Bruker example shows 4 gradient echo times from 3 to 15 ms". I chose something in between that somewhat matches each.

Possible upload issue: I went to view the data at LONI and I noticed that the T2Star data has some contradictions in the way it is reported/stored at least as seen in the viewer.

The T2Star_map was acquired as one series. It appears in the archive/review page as four separate series of 30 images each (which is fine). However, when I go to view these series, it shows only 7 or 8 slices for each. Each series does show images from a single one of the four echo times, but only a *total* of 30 slices among the four series, not all 30 slices for each echo time.

I don't know if this is a limitation of just the viewer or if the data is not appropriately saved/sorted in the archives. It may be possible to have the acquisition generate separate series for each echo time even if they are acquired in one scan, or it could be done after the fact by changing the series number/UID prior to uploading.
