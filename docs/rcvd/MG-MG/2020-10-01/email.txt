Thanks -- I haven't worked with TTC before, so it's interesting to check it out.  By the way, I met with Cenk today to review the segmentations, and he had a few concerns that he thought could be helped by looking at TTC, so perhaps I'll start another thread for that so we can discuss

There are two TINY hemorrhages here, likely way too small for you to detect. We will keep looking for some good hemorrhages, but for now, do not do any further work on this.

Hi Karisma and Jessica,

Attached are the TTC images for the 5 animals we did for the 48h endpoint. Hemorrhage is present in animals QC3021, slices #3-5, and QC3025, slice #5.

Best,
