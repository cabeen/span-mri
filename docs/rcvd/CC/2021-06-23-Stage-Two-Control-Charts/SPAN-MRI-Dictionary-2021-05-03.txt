adc_qa_snr:
	the signal-to-noise ratio of the diffusion scan.  computed by taking the
  ratio of the average signal of foreground (head) over the average signal of
  background (air) 

t2_qa_snr:
	the signal-to-noise ratio of the T2 scan.  computed by taking the
  ratio of the average signal of foreground (head) over the average signal of

midline_shift_left:
  the distance of the midline to the left lateral extent of the brain (mm)

midline_shift_right
  the distance of the midline to the right lateral extent of the brain (mm)

midline_shift_percent:
	the percentage of total brain width taken by the distance of the apparent
  midline to the expected midline (percentage 0 to 100)

midline_shift_ratio:
	the ratio of the minimum shift over the maximum shift, taken from the left
  and right distances above, i.e. min(midline_shift_left, midline_shift_right)    / max(midline_shift_left, midline_shift_right)

midline_shift_index
	the lateralization index of the difference of the left and right distances
  over the average of the left and right (unitless). i.e. (midline_shift_right 
  - midline_shift_left) / (midline_shift_left + midline_shift_right) / 2.0

midline_tissue_volume_left
  the volume of brain tissue in the left hemisphere (mm3)

midline_tissue_volume_right
