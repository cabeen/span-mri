Background

- Add brief intro to SPAN?
    - Animal model, how is stroke induced?
- What other automated segmentation approaches exist in this model, if any?

Approach

- IDA central database
- Other aspects of pipeline
    - Image data harmonization
    - Brain extraction
    - CSF segmentation
- Issues
    - Limitations of atlas based approach (we have big differences between individuals)
- Other considerations
    - Intra-lesion ADC/T2 heterogeneity?
    - User study of TTC segmentation?
        - Demonstrate perceptual limitations in boundary drawing

Data results

- Manual vs auto delineation on MRI (i.e. no TTC)
- T2 start artifact
- Quality across sites
    - Differences in noise and contrast
    - Differences in parameter estimates
    - We mitigated these to some extent

Discussion

- hemorrhage quantification
    - comment on why it wasn't possible with our T2star data
    - time limitations?
    - what alternatives exist? SWI?
- What factors may explain inter-site differences
    - hardware: scanner, field strength, coils, shielding, operator?
    - physical environment: temperature, humidity, elevation/pressure, scanner room characteristics?
    - specimen: preparation, stress, feeding, time of day?
- Can this approach be expanded to other projects (yes, most likely)
    - What can be done in the future?
- Translational considerations
    - What are the prospects to moving this to humans?
    - What challenges exist there?
- Sharing tools?

Comments

- Why a tissue readout from MRI?
    - In humans, timing is an issue
    - In animals, neurological assessment
        - Neurological exams are often at different times too
        - Scoring systems are noisy, and up to interpretation due to language
- Other ways to measure damage
    - Other cellular and molecular markers exist
        - Counting cells, density of proteins
        - Necrosis vs apoptosis vs alive - we can stain for each of these for cell death indices
        - These are less useful than infarct volume
    - TTC
        - staining limitations
            - Intensity and contrast are ambiguous sometimes
            - after staining, we can look at hemoglobin content, but not much else
            - it's TTC or nothing (vs MRI which is non-invasive)
        - brain volume and shape is not preserved
            - brain shifts and deformations, loss of CSF pressure
            - the lesion will often compress the contra side, CSF leaves to make space, unless there is a blockage of CSF drainage
            - "hyperosmolar state", tissue sucks up more water, when the brain is sitting in solution, it can enlarge the brain.  does this change the infact volume differentially?
        - clinical correlate: no comparison to humans!
    - Histology
        - Very low throughput, expensive, time consuming
        - no clinical correlate again
    - What we need and will do
        - clinical correlate is important for clinical trial
        - MRI advantages
            - whole brain, longitudinal, non-invasive, clinical correlation, preserves tissue, lower inter-operator variability
        - talk about SPAN as our route to accomplish this
    - Challenges
        - Time limitations - people and equipment
        - Changes in equipment and people over duration of the study
- Approach and methods
    - Stroke model - this is well established, minimize discussion and include relevant references
    - Why did we do 2 day and 30 day?
    - Data management
        - Upload process verification
        - Metadata etc.
    - Mention T2-star acquired in pilot
    - Mention COVID effect on pilot?
    - TTC comparison
        - in pilot - MRI can pick up very subtle changes in TTC
    - Histology at 30 day
        - Some sites may not section the whole lesion (time crunch)
        - We can compare the slices that coincide with MRI though
    - Question, what are we doing for tissue loss (ipsi, contra)
    - Neurological correlations likely exist for pilot, but they are not available
        - We can compare pilot vs stage 1 with that
        - Important to compare location of infarct in 2d MRI to outcome (mortality or neuro deficit)
        - How does 2d compare to 30 day w.r.t. outcome?
        - Discussion point: If 2 day is highly predictive, why do we need 30 day?
    - Pitfalls
        - Stroke model: filament trauma and misplacement
            - Point to MRI that shows this?
            - Maybe we can use T2 star to see bleeding?
            - Subarachnoid hemorrhage? This may be indication for mortality
        - MRI - limitations of scanning hardware etc.
- Discussion
    - MRI cost vs TTC and histology
    - What can we not see with anything? Selective neuronal loss (only indirect effects)
    - Hemorrhage imaging issues
