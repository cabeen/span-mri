ADC scans

- U Iowa scans each bvalue separately, all other sites have a combined scan
- QC2310 from Yale had a duplicate ADC scan
    - In this case they were identical, so I added code to skip the second one
    - Why did this happen?  Is it safe to always choose one arbitrarily?
    - update: this was caused by a failure during upload, leading to two copies

RARE

- QC3894 from JHU and QC2310 from Yale had duplicates
