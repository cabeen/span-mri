Please take the time to review the list and respond back to the CC by Tuesday 11am PST with additional variables to consider. Decisions will be made on 9/24. We look forward to hearing your feedback.

Variables to be considered: 
Will there be a Baseline Corner ?
Will there be 10 turns for Corner? 
Will sites do Asleep or Awake MCAo ?
Will Stage 1 Male, Female, or Both? 
Will sites be required to assess behavior according to light/dark Cycle?
Will we standardize the time of surgery? 
Suture size for stage 1?

Will 3 raters be assigned to videos? 
Will there be 3 behavior assessments? 

Best,
The Coordinating Center
