Issues:

- Data organization
    - Sites will update meta-data separately
    - Some sites may upload many files instead of one
    - There will be 1000s of scans so this should be automated
- Joe's suggestions
    - Surface coil is not okay for multi-echo
    - Repeated Single-echo is slower but more compatible
    - Volume coil is ideal
- Lyden:
    - main goal is stroke lesion volume
    - LONI should use this downtime to implement systems
- Fahmeed suggestions:
    - we have one non-Bruker site (Iowa) using Agilent (see TODO)
    - Look at example1 vs example2 - these are of the same specimen but differ in multi-echo approach
- Stroke 2 day vs 30 day
    - Lyden: TTE data for validation is good
    - Include a TSE RARE scan?  4-6 minutes
        - use for comparison of 2d vs 30d
    - Atrophy is an important analysis

TODO:

- Reach out to Karen about this data
    - See the email "test ADC" which has an example
