TODO:
* look into Iowa smaller total brain volume
* we can request a phantom to be scanner
* Fahmeed points out that gradient issues can systematically affect volume
* create per-site volumetric maps of lesion location and image contrast
* falcon tubes are phantoms we can use
* add negative shifts to pipeline
* send total brain volume plots
* check outliers
