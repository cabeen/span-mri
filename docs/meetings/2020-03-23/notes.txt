Who: Lyden, Ayata Cenk, Fahmeed Hyder, Basavaraju Ganganna, Joe Mandeville

Joe:

- We need a way to maintain metadata
- We can try to harmonize but there are hardware differences
- How to harmonize acquisition:
    - place scans in a specific order
    - use harmonized names
- Current climate makes the test scanning infeasible
    - not April as planned...
- Surface coils are potentially problematic for multi-echo
- Sites should be able to self-evaluate their data

Fahmeed:

- The contrast in the slides is ideal, we should target that
- Thought: we can collect many echos and adc to find an optimal sequence for each site
- Create a phantom for testing
    - We can experiment with T2, ADC, etc

Lyden:

- Preclinical MRI reduces the number  of animals and experiments needed.  If you use histology, you need multiple animals for each time point, MRI can combine these cases
- We need to be careful about real-time feedback due to blinding
- Meet every two weeks ideally

Cenk:

- T2 and ADC are less meaningful at 30day?
    - Tissue loss is a big factor

Basu:

- Scan time is roughly 40 minutes with one-echo-at-a-time

Heterogeneity in data has some opportunities, how good are harmonization techniques?

- We need a few comprehensive test scans even if there are differences among continuing data  collections
- We can make sure that more limited scans are a subset of others
- We should think experimentally and measure differences
- Compare the surface vs volume coils

Meta-data issues

- We need a metadata database
    - indexes the protocol for each site
    - issue: the b-values and echos are not preserved in the DICOM
    - potential issue: there are often repeated scans due to problems
- Some "multi-echo" is repeated scans some are from single sequence
    - "Single echo" is the first option, and it is slower, but easier to harmonize across sites
- The DICOM should uniquely identify the site, okay if it doesn't store all quantitative parameters

Sources of differences

- Number and values of echos and b-values
    - Whether they have a nice tx coil
- Signal homogeneity
    - (due to coils?)
