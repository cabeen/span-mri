Meeting with Cenk

- Papers
    - Initial methods paper
    - Second describing controls
        - Variables: Age, Sex, Site, Laser dopler
    - Third reporting association between MRI with behavior
        - Variables: stroke outcome
- Basal brain artifact
    - Quadrigeminal cistern
    - We can exclude it from a mask
- Lateral perioptical artifact
    - Is it optical stroke? We can test that
    - Is it related to turning behavior
- TODO:
    - Compute double derivatives
    - Can we extract a parameter summarizing the shape?
    - Can we estimate the slope in a window , e.g. 500 to 800
    - Plan:
        - Pick an upper threshold for measuring volume
        - Look at outliers of trajectories
    - Two patterns:
        - Fast ramp up to big lesion, are they real?
        - Fast gradual ramp to slower
- Updated lesion segmentations
    - New Threshold: 875
    - New exclusion mask (removes basal artifact, but not perioptical one)
    - Next tuesday at noon

Stage One PI Rehash Meeting: July 13

The staining is inconsistent

Try 0.85? with more restrictive lesion mask

Look for repeated with different FoV

For tuesday meeting:

- Show a few cases: Rats, Aged, Obese
- Show image contrast

How to find a good threshold?

- Look for plateau in lesion vs threshold plot?
    - How to meaningfully compare different lesion sizes
- Compare lesion volume vs. later atrophy?
